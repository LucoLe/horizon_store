##### Imagine you're working for a store which sells (only) 3 products:

```
Code         | Name         |  Price
-------------------------------------------------
VOUCHER      | Voucher      |   5.00€
TSHIRT       | T-Shirt      |  20.00€
MUG          | Coffee Mug   |   7.50€
```

Various departments have insisted on the following discounts:

 * The marketing department believes in 2-for-1 promotions (buy two of the same product, get one free), and would like for there to be a 2-for-1 special on `VOUCHER` items.

 * The CFO insists that the best way to increase sales is with discounts on bulk purchases (buying x or more of a product, the price of that product is reduced), and demands that if you buy 3 or more `TSHIRT` items, the price per unit should be 19.00€.

The store's checkout process allows for items to be scanned in any order, and should return the total amount to be paid. The interface for the checkout process looks like this (ruby):

```ruby
co = Checkout.new(pricing_rules)
co.scan("VOUCHER")
co.scan("VOUCHER")
co.scan("TSHIRT")
price = co.total
```

Our sales team is constantly adding, removing, and repricing products, so they should be configurable with a json file.

Examples:

    Items: VOUCHER, TSHIRT, MUG
    Total: 32.50€

    Items: VOUCHER, TSHIRT, VOUCHER
    Total: 25.00€

    Items: TSHIRT, TSHIRT, TSHIRT, VOUCHER, TSHIRT
    Total: 81.00€

    Items: VOUCHER, TSHIRT, VOUCHER, VOUCHER, MUG, TSHIRT, TSHIRT
    Total: 74.50€
